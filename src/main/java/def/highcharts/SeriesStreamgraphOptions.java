/**
 * (Highcharts, Highstock) A `streamgraph` series. If the type option is not
 * specified, it is inherited from chart.type.
 *
 * In TypeScript the type option must always be set.
 *
 * Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:
 *
 * 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the plotOptions.series
 * object.
 *
 * 2. Options for all `streamgraph` series are defined in
 * plotOptions.streamgraph.
 *
 * 3. Options for one single series are given in the series instance array. (see
 * online documentation for example)
 *
 * You have to extend the `SeriesStreamgraphOptions` via an interface to allow
 * custom properties: ``` declare interface SeriesStreamgraphOptions {
 * customProperty: string; }

     *
     * 1. An array of numerical values. In this case, the numerical values will
     * be interpreted as `y` options. The `x` values will be automatically
     * calculated, either starting at 0 and incremented by 1, or from
     * `pointStart` and `pointInterval` given in the series options. If the axis
     * has categories, these will be used. Example: (see online documentation
     * for example)
     *
     * 2. An array of arrays with 2 values. In this case, the values correspond
     * to `x,y`. If the first value is a string, it is applied as the name of
     * the point, and the `x` value is inferred. (see online documentation for
     * example)
     *
     * 3. An array of objects with named values. The following snippet shows
     * only a few settings, see the complete options set below. If the total
     * number of data points exceeds the series' turboThreshold, this option is
     * not available. (see online documentation for example)
